Simple Shell is a command-line interpreter written in the C programming language, and it aims to replicate the basic functionality of the Unix BourneShell (sh). Users can interact with it by entering commands, and it will execute those commands, similar to how a typical Unix shell would operate, but with a simplified set of features.
